  "litw-irb-body-1-p2": "We are trying to understand the way people have been influenced by their cultural background, and whether this affects how people process information. More specifically, this study aims to clarify whether some people are better in ignoring contextual information than others. Our aim is to apply the results to different user interface designs.",
  "litw-irb-body-2-p1": "What will you have to do?",
  "litw-irb-body-2-p2": "We will be asking you to pay attention to a square box within which you will see a vertical line. Subsequently, you will be shown another square box of the same or different size and asked to reproduce the line that you have seen in the frame before. Pressing the back button or leaving the test will cause all progress to be lost. You will receive more specific instructions shortly.",
  "litw-irb-body-3-p1": "What will you get out of it?",
  "litw-irb-body-3-p2": "We will give you feedback on how your results compare to those of other participants. The final results from this experiment will be posted on our blog page.
